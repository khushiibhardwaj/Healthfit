### Problem Statement
- These days, kids are always playing video games and frequently use their phones for the same purpose, which is bad for their health. Playing games and sitting still for extended periods of time limits people's physical mobility and makes them sluggish. This frequently has negative effects including weakening of the muscles, making it a bad choice for enjoyment.
- These days, people's schedules are so busy that they don't have time to visit the gym. Both mental and physical illnesses can result from physical inactivity.

### Objective and Solution

To assist users enjoy games and be healthy at the same time, we intend to develop a gamified fitness platform. Our project idea is to offer a gamified workout experience. Our project will primarily be implemented using machine learning algorithms in Python. To get their avatar to move on the screen and mimic real-life motion, players would need to run, jump, and perform other physical activities. We intend to offer awards at various levels in order to inspire the users. For instance, a prize will be awarded for each n situps, or the player can even be able to unlock the game's life only after completing certain fitness exercises. Therefore, the main goal is to blend enjoyment with fitness.

### Existing Solutions in the Market

- The majority of currently available solutions on the market are unsuitable for youngsters and solely address the demands of adults.
- In order to compare progress with peers, encourage participation by providing a leaderboard that tracks calories burned rather than game scores.
- The ability to play games in real time while exercising and staying active is not available.

### How is this Different

### TechStack

- Step 1 Creating The Model
Firstly, We will use Python, Machine Learning, Deep Learning for training our model and capturing real-time gestures. We will use different libraries like TensorFlow, OpenCV, MediaPipe for this purpose.

- Step 2 Implementing The Model
We will create a game to implement our model. We will use Scratch for creating this game and we will integrate our python model with this game.

### Implementation

- Upon entering the platform, the user will be presented with fitness objectives to do. Upon successful completion, the user will receive points and be able to access the game's lives. 
To have the avatar on the screen mimic the player, the player must move in real life when they first enter the game. Python, machine learning, deep learning, and certain libraries like Tensor Flow, Open CV, and Media Pipe will be used to record the user's activities in real-time video. The identified actions will be transformed into the avatar's actions and displayed on the screen (in the game).
- The display of a leader board will encourage players to do more tasks and obtain Fit-Game badges.

### Future Scope
- We require a solution that balances enjoyment with health, given the increasing worries about kids' health and the addictive qualities of video games.
- The usage of video and mobile games has increased dramatically since the Covid-19 pandemic, negatively impacting people's health.
- As a result, we can declare with confidence that this application has a bright future and the admirable objective of helping our kids get back in shape.
